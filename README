My first ML Projects

I am following the steps of the book "python machine learning by example"
The strutcure in which I write the code should be amended and made cleaner once complete

To complete these projects I have setup miniconda and have installed the following librarbies in my env:

- tensorflow
- pytorch
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

Before writing any code ensure the environment is activated so the code can be interpretted.

env is "firstMLProject"

conda activate firstMLProject

conda deactivate
